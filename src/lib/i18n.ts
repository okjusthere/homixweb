We pair a bilingual team across Flushing, Queens and Long Island with AI-assisted pricing and marketing — so your home reaches the right buyers, in the right language, on the platforms they already trust.",
    p1: "Homix started with a camera, not a \"for sale\" sign. Before there was a brokerage, there was an audience — neighbors who followed founder Si Zhang (\"Sunny\") for honest, in-language explanations of how New York real estate actually works: what a co-op board really wants, why one block trades at a premium over the next, how to read a Queens listing between the lines. That media-first habit is still the whole point. We believe the best way to earn a client is to be genuinely useful long before anyone is ready to buy or sell, and to keep showing up after the deal closes.",
    p2: "That origin shapes how we operate. Our team is bilingual by default — fluent in English and Mandarin, and fluent in the realities of Flushing, the rest of Queens and Long Island, where so many families are making their first or biggest American purchase. We use AI where it earns its place: pricing a home against fresh comparables, drafting marketing in two languages, matching the right buyer to the right home faster. The technology stays behind the scenes; the relationship stays in front. Whether you're buying your first apartment or listing the home you raised a family in, you get a team that already knows your neighborhood — and an audience that's already listening.",
